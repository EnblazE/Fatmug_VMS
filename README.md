Fatmug VMS or Vendor Management System is a Django-based assignment made for Fatmug as part of recruitment process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This assignment tests my ability to create a functional Django-based system for vendor
 management, integrating aspects of data handling, API development, and basic performance
 metric calculations.
 Vendor Management system lets you create Vendors through RESTful browsable API and also Purchase Orders for each vendor.
 It also provides a exclusive Vendor performance metric system which works on real-time data and presents us with various metrics using
 modern interative charts.
